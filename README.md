# Clash of Claws 🐱

An arcade-style pixel-art web app where a fearless cat races through obstacles and takes on an increasingly difficult panda boss at the end of each level

### Phase 1 – Obstacle Run
- The player controls a cat avatar.
- The cat automatically runs forward.
- Avoid obstacles by:
  - Pressing `SPACE` to jump
  - Pressing `DOWN ARROW` to duck
- Obstacles include:
  - **Spikes** (jump over)
  - **Tree Stumps** (timed jumps required)


### Phase 2 – Boss Fight
- A panda boss appears at the end of each level.
- The player uses `SPACE` to shoot projectiles.
- The panda has a visible health bar.
- Defeat the panda to advance to the next level.


Each level increases:
- Obstacle speed
- Spawn frequency
- Boss health
- Boss attack speed
